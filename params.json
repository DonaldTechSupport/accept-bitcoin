We use [blockr](http://blockr.io) API instead.\r\n  - No need to install any wallet client. \r\n  - Create ad-hoc address to accept bitcoins and transfer incomes to your offline account.\r\n  - Easy configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Get Started\r\n\r\nSimply install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnpm install accept-bitcoin\r\n```\r\nLoad AC and you're ready to go!\r\n```javascript\r\nvar acceptBitcoin = require('accept-bitcoin');\r\nvar ac = new acceptBitcoin('YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS');\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Motivation \r\nAccepting bitcoins online can be complex to program and require you to install a bitcoin RPC client in order to read and write to the blockchain. This client require a lot of resources (in terms of CPU, networking and storage).  \r\nMost of the users are using a wallet to store their bitcoins. This wallet is a simple way to secure your public and private key. For security reasons you better save this wallet offline in a \"cold storage\".  \r\nMore about the motivation behind this project at [my blog post](http://sagivo.com/post/97125970778/bitcoin-on-node-js-do-it-yourself).\r\n\r\n##Example\r\nYou can override the default settings on creating\r\n\r\nExamples are provided [here](https://github.com/sagivo/accept-bitcoin/tree/master/examples)\r\n```javascript\r\nvar settings = {network: 'live'}\r\nvar acceptBitcoin = require('accept-bitcoin');\r\nvar ac = new acceptBitcoin('YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS', settings);\r\nkey = ac.generateAddress({alertWhenHasBalance: true});\r\nconsole.log(\"Hello buyer! please pay to: \" + key.address());\r\nkey.on('hasBalance', function(amount){\r\n  console.log(\"thanks for paying me \" + amount); //do stuff\r\n  key.transferBalanceToMyAccount(function(err, d){\r\n    if (d.status === 'success') console.log(\"Cool, the bitcoins are in my private account!\");\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Settings\r\n\r\nYou can override the default settings:  \r\n\r\n| name                    | type   | default value                | comment                                                                                                                                                                 |\r\n|-------------------------|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `payToAddress`          | string | -                            | Your bitcoin adress you wish to transfer incomes to.                                                                                                                    |\r\n| `network`               | string | test                         | choose your bitcoin RPC env. values are: `test` and `live`more info [here](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/cd353ac02e76fb3294c40366d8d5dc04ce1939d7/networks.js) |\r\n| `password`              | string | -                            | choose your random password to encrypt generated keys.                                                                                                                  |\r\n| `storePath`             | string | `./keys.txt`                 | path to store a file containing all the ad-hoc generated keys.                                                                                                          |\r\n| `encryptPrivateKey`     | bool   | false                        | in case you want the stored keys to be encrypted (using `password`).                                                                                                    |\r\n| `payReminderToAddress`  | string | payToAddress                 | In case transfer amount is smaller than income and fees.                                                                                                                |\r\n| `includeUnconfirmed`    | bool   | false                        | include unconfirmed transactions when checking for unspent incomes                                                                                                      |\r\n| `checkTransactionEvery` | int    | 1000 * 60 * 2  (2 minutes)   | how often (in millisecond) to ping the network when checking for transactions.                                                                                          |\r\n| `checkBalanceTimeout`   | int    | 1000 * 60 * 60 * 2 (2 hours) | timeout (in millisecond) when checking balance of an address.                                                                                                           |\r\n| `checkUnspentTimeout`   | int    | 1000 * 60 * 60 * 2 (2 hours) | timeout (in millisecond) when checking unspent transactions of an address.                                                                                              |\r\n| `minimumConfirmations`  | int    | 6                            | minimum confirmations needed in order to trigger `hasBalance` event.                                                                                                    |\r\n| `txFee`                 | float  | 0.0001                       | fee (in bitcoin) for transferring amount from ad hoc address to your address.                                                                                           |\r\n\r\n###Key class\r\nThis class is responsible for creating new bitcoin addresses, storing them and transferring funds between them. Some key functions are:  \r\n`storeKey(wk)` - store your key in a local file. Can be encrypted.  \r\n`checkBalance()`- check and notify you when an address has minimum balance.\r\n`payTo(payToAddress, options, callback)` - transfer all balance of this address to another address.\r\n\r\n###Encrypt class\r\nContains helpers to encrypt and decrypt strings. Used for storing your keys data locally.  \r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\nPlease do. Fork it, star it, share it and add your code to the project. Help others.  \r\nAll the src code is written in [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) and is under `src`. There's a tool that convert it automatically to js each time you change a file and put it under `lib` folder. Simply run `cake build` for that. \r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nMIT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
